## Project Summary 📋
* Using third-party APIs from OpenWeatherMap, FontAwesome & Bootstrap, the challenge is to build a 5 day forecast app
* The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS elements
* The app must use localStorage to store persistent data from searched cities and show previous searches
-----
# Initial Work & Study 💻  
* Searched through previous classes, online tutorials on API integration, learning Xpert
* Scheduled regular meetings with my mentor 
* Goal: to understand how use dynamic HTML elements built through JS
* Created a sample weather app prototype (single day forecast) to get a sense of style and placement 
* Completed side project prototype:

# Collaboration Workflow 🦾
* After reviewing some of my work with my mentor who helped further my understanding, I reworked the JavaScript to “clean it up”
* Requested information details from Xpert Learning Assistant for assistance on proper syntax and understanding logic behind the code
* Finally, reviewed additional JavaScript course materials and connected a final time with my mentor

-----
## Summary of Challenges 📝  
JavaScript
* Integrating changes to the base URL for the code took considerable time to get correct
* Using updated ES6 knowledge from Node.js Day 1 helped refine a lot of my code 
* Was unable to figure out localStorage for persistent data and previously searched cities

CSS
* Using Bootstrap elements makes it difficult to target elements for customized styles 
* Learned to use !important to override specific styles implemented by Bootstrap
* Need to review CSS code to remove repeated or unused elements
